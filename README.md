# Sample Hardhat FundMe Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
yarn hardhat deploy
```
